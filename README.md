Nonequilibrium pattern formation in some important models - this is again something that we will add to, and improve upon regularly.

For C-H and Spinodal - first cut is simple state space Eulerian integration. Nothing fancy. Fourier space methods and fully implicit schemes like Crank-Nicholson will be the next steps
